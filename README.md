# Fixed Vanishing Header

Create the webpage as shown in the design mockup below

![design mockup](fixed-vanishing-header.gif)

### Specifications

> - The navbar should always stay at the top of the page when scrolling
> - The background image and header title should stay fixed when scrolling
> - When we scroll, the content should go on top of the header, so we see an effect of the header slowly getting "eaten up"
> - Use any image you like or use `unsplash.it/500/500` for a random dummy image

#### Good luck and have fun!
